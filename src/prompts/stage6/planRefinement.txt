The following generated roo-plan.md content failed validation for the following reasons: {{planValidationIssues}}.

Please regenerate the plan correctly based on the original project details and available mode slugs. Ensure it:
1.  Starts with a Title and the Concise Goal.
2.  Identifies the correct primary/entry-point mode from the available slugs and uses `<switch_mode>` in the first step.
3.  Is structured into logical phases using Markdown headers.
4.  Uses `<new_task>` correctly for delegation to appropriate modes.
5.  Uses valid XML tags.
6.  Includes valid, properly escaped JSON within each `<message>` tag, containing the required keys (`goal`, `contextSummary`, `detailedInstructions`, `toolNotes`, `completionCriteria`).
