Review the following project analysis. Verify the following:
1.  **Presence of Sections:** Does the analysis include ALL of these specific bolded sections: **Core functionality and features**, **Technical requirements**, **User interaction patterns**, **Agentic Capabilities & Workflow Considerations**, **Potential challenges**, **Ambiguities and Clarifications**?
2.  **Technical Requirements Check:** Does the **Technical requirements** section mention specific technologies (languages, frameworks, databases, APIs, libraries) OR explicitly state that none were specified/obvious? Does it consider MCP servers where relevant?
3.  **Agentic Capabilities Check:** Does the **Agentic Capabilities & Workflow Considerations** section address potential use of Browser Use, MCP, and Boomerang Tasks, even if just to state they aren't applicable?
4.  **Ambiguities Check:** Does the **Ambiguities and Clarifications** section list at least one ambiguity OR explicitly state that the description was clear?
5.  **Overall Completeness:** Are there any glaring omissions or sections that are completely empty or nonsensical based *only* on the provided analysis text?

If ALL checks pass and the analysis seems reasonable, respond ONLY with the word "OK".
If ANY check fails or significant improvements are needed (e.g., missing sections, vague technical details where specifics could be inferred, missing ambiguity list, missing agentic considerations), provide a refined and complete version of the ENTIRE analysis addressing the issues. Do NOT just describe the issues; provide the improved analysis directly.

Respond ONLY with the refined analysis OR the word "OK".
