Generate the content for a .rooignore file suitable for the project described below.

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  Start the response *immediately* with `# .rooignore for [Project Name/Purpose]` using a suitable name/purpose based on the input. NO other text before this line.
2.  Include common ignores like `.git/`, `node_modules/` (at the root), `.vscode/`, `.env`, logs, etc.
3.  Include ignores specific to the technologies and project type identified in the input (e.g., Python's `__pycache__`, Node's `build/`/`dist/` folders, OS-specific files).
4.  **MCP Server Consideration:** If the project structure includes directories for custom MCP servers (e.g., `mcp_servers/my_server/`), add ignores for their specific build artifacts or dependencies (e.g., `mcp_servers/*/node_modules/`, `mcp_servers/*/build/`).
5.  Use `#` for all comments and section headers.
6.  The entire output must be plain text suitable for a `.rooignore` file. NO MARKDOWN.
