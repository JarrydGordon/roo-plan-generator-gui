Generate the complete replacement system prompt content for the Roo Code mode "{{footgunTargetMode}}". This content will entirely replace the default system prompt for this mode in this specific project.

**CONTEXT (Project Analysis & Structure):**
{{structureResultMd}}

**REASON FOR OVERRIDE (Inferred):**
(The analysis suggested a need to override the default system prompt for "{{footgunTargetMode}}".)

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  Generate the raw text content that should be placed inside the `.roo/system-prompt-{{footgunTargetMode}}` file.
2.  This content MUST define the mode's complete behavior, including its core role, personality, instructions, and potentially how it should use tools (as the default tool descriptions will be bypassed).
3.  **Agentic Considerations:** Based on the project context and the intended overridden purpose of the `{{footgunTargetMode}}`, the generated system prompt should include specific instructions on *how* and *when* this mode should leverage agentic capabilities, if applicable. This might include:
    *   Guidance on using `browser_action` for specific web interactions.
    *   Instructions on utilizing relevant MCP tools (identified in the context).
    *   Rules for initiating subtasks (`new_task`) if this mode is expected to delegate work.
4.  The output MUST be ONLY the raw text content for the file. Do NOT include any introductory phrases, explanations, or markdown formatting outside the prompt content itself.
