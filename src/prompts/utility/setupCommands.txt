Based on the following details of a newly generated project, suggest a sequence of shell commands for initial setup.

**Project Directory:**
{{directoryPath}}

**Generated Artifacts (Root Level):**
{{artifactList}}

**Scaffolded Structure Summary (Top Level):**
{{structureSummary}}

**Instructions:**
1.  Generate a list of likely useful setup commands for a user opening a terminal in the project directory.
2.  Start with `cd "{{directoryPath}}"`.
3.  Infer common setup steps based on the artifacts and structure (e.g., `npm install` if `package.json` exists, `pip install -r requirements.txt` if `requirements.txt` exists, `git init`, etc.). Consider other common project types (Python virtual environments, build steps, etc.).
4.  Include a basic `git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit from RooCodeGen"` sequence at the end, unless the context strongly suggests otherwise (e.g., if a `.git` directory was part of the scaffolded structure).
5.  Format the output as a JSON array of strings, where each string is a single command.
6.  Do NOT include any explanatory text, just the JSON array.

Example Output Format:
```json
[
  "cd \"/path/to/project\"",
  "npm install",
  "git init",
  "git add .",
  "git commit -m \"Initial commit from RooCodeGen\""
]
```

Generate the JSON array of commands below:
